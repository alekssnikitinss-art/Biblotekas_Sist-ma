Start instructions for Bibliotēkas_Sistēma (Windows PowerShell)

This file contains the minimal steps to get the backend + frontend running locally and to verify the app works.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed and available as `python` (you appear to have 3.13)
- Internet access to install packages, or install from wheels offline if required

1) (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
PowerShell:

    # create venv folder named .venv
    python -m venv .venv
    # activate venv in PowerShell
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

2) Install dependencies

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install flask flask-cors

(If you prefer a requirements file, run: `python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing.)

3) Start the backend server

From the project root (where `app.py` is located):

    cd 'c:\Users\Dators\Bibloteka\Biblotekas_Sist-ma'
    python .\app.py

Notes:
- By default the server will bind to host 0.0.0.0 and port 5000. The script prints the startup URL.
- To bind only to localhost, run:

    $env:HOST='127.0.0.1'; python .\app.py

- To change port, e.g. 8000:

    $env:PORT='8000'; python .\app.py

4) Open the app in your browser (recommended)

Open the UI served by Flask (same origin as the API):

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Important: Do NOT open `index.html` directly via file:// if you want same-origin API calls; browse to the Flask URL above so the frontend fetches `/api/...` on the same origin.

5) Quick API checks (PowerShell)

While the server is running in a separate terminal, test endpoints:

    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/statistika' -Method GET
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/grāmatas' -Method GET

These should return JSON (or an empty list/object) rather than connection errors.

6) Troubleshooting

- "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" in browser or "Unable to connect" in PowerShell:
  - Ensure `python .\app.py` is running and did not exit with an error.
  - Check the terminal where you started the server for any exception traces.
  - Confirm the server printed something like `* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

- Missing package errors (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_cors'):
  - Run `python -m pip install flask-cors`

- Port already in use:
  - Choose another port: `$env:PORT='8000'; python .\app.py`
  - Or find and stop the process occupying 5000 (use `netstat -a -n -o | findstr ":5000"` and check PID in Task Manager).

- Firewall blocks access:
  - For local dev, binding to `127.0.0.1` avoids opening firewall to the network.
  - If you need remote access, allow the port in Windows Firewall or run behind a proper server.

7) Helpful dev tips

- If you prefer to run the server in the background, start it in a separate terminal and keep that terminal open.
- To seed or reset the DB, delete `biblioteka.db` and `dati_jau_pievienoti.txt` then restart the server. The script will recreate DB and seed sample data.

8) Optional additions you can make

- Add `requirements.txt` (pip freeze) so others can install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Create `run.ps1` for convenience containing the recommended env setup and `python .\app.py` command.
- Add a health endpoint `/api/health` if you want a single lightweight check for monitoring.

If you'd like, I can create a `requirements.txt` and `run.ps1` for you now; tell me which you'd prefer and I'll add them.
